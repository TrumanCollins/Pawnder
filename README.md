# Pawnder
My Pawnder chess program I wrote for my senior project in computer science in 1986.

I wrote it when I was at Willamette University. It was initially written in Pascal,
but I converted it to C++ in the 1990s and added some features like hashtables and
a few other improvements.

It plays a reasonable game tactically, but has strategic gaps and endgame problems.
In comparison with modern chess programs, it does poorly.
